## Initial Setup instructions

1. Read `Guide.md` and explore
2. To get a spaceship vim-like omni-bar in firefox, copy the `chrome` folder from the `firefox` folder to `$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/<your user profile>`
3. Set the background to the image in `Library/Images`
4. Enter tmux by pressing entering `tm` and reload it by entering `<Ctrl+s>R`
5. Install some packages for yourself using `cargo add`, `pi`, or `yi` - (when in doubt, just use `yi`)
6. Consult the documentation and numerous help resources online for information about parts of spaceship - e.g. Manjaro Wiki, AUR, Spacemacs Wiki, Ranger wiki, Vim wiki...
